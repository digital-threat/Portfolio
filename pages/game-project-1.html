                <h3>Character, Camera, Controls</h3>
                <p>
                    My primary responsibility on the project was to create a player controller. The requirements included an orbiting camera, ability to jump, double jump, sprint and slide down steep slopes. I used Unity's built-in kinematic character controller as a base. I also implemented a state machine as a core structure of the controller to encapsulate different player states.
                </p>
                <h4>Slopes &amp; Slides</h4>
                <p>An aspect of the controller I particularly struggled with was handling slopes.</p>
                <h4>Reflection</h4>
                <p>
                    Working on Jim &amp; Jam has taught me much about the inherent complexity of character controllers. I don't want to sound too academic, but in all fairness it's a prime example of the multifaceted nature of game development. A good character controller is a synergy between level design, game feel and robust collision resolution. And if one or more of those areas aren't up to par? Well, you may get something that controls more like a tank than a rat.
