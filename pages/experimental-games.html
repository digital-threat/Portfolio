            <h2>Experimental Games</h2>
            <p>In February-March 2023 I developed 4 digital games as part of the 'Experimental Game Design' course in a team with 2 other students. Each game was developed in 2 weeks and explores a different theme.</p>
            <h3>Frog Choir</h3>
            <h4>Theme: Game & Watch</h4>
            <div class = "project_info">
                <p>Year: 2023</p>
                <p>Engine: Unity</p>
                <p>Time: 2 weeks (20h/week)</p>
                <p>Team Size: 3</p>
                <p>Role: Original Idea, Programmer (Solo), Designer</p>
            </div>
            <p>Frog choir is made in the style of Game & Watch. You play as a choir conductor that must keep the frog choir from going off pitch. The better you are able to keep the frogs on pitch, the larger the audience and your high score.</p>
            <h4>Comments:</h4>
            <p>Originally, I envisioned each frog would have a different voice register (soprano, alto, etc.) as well as have different singing parts. Like a real choir! We weren’t quite able to realize that idea in reality and I still wonder how the choir would sound if we did.</p>
